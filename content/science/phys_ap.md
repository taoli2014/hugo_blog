### Special relativity

Einstein's two postulates.

> **FIRST POSTULATE OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY**  
> The laws of physics are the same and can be stated in their simplest form in all inertial frames of reference.  

An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force.

> **SECOND POSTULATE OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY**  
> The speed of light is a constant, independent of the relative motion of the source.  

The Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of the Earth about the Sun.

Simultaneity
: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.

Time dilation
: The phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.
